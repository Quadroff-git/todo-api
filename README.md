# todo-api
A simple web api to keep track of a todo list built to practice using manually configured Spring and Hibernate, 
as well as some other popular libraries 

## The stack:
- Maven used as build tool
- Hibernate ORM + MySQL for persistence
- Certain Spring components:
  - DI and IoC container
  - Hibernate integration
  - Transaction management
  - Web MVC(coming soon)
- JUnit tests
  - Pure unit tests with mock objects for certain components(coming soon)
  - Integration tests using both Spring Test and manual DI
- Lombok to reduce boilerplate

## Building
